# Tomato Timer Chrome Extension

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

I built this Tomato Timer Chrome Extension by using Javascript, CSS and HTML.
